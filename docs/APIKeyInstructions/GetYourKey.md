# Get your free API Key to enable WeatherCast app for Fitbit!  

The following instructions will provide you with a key that will allow you to refresh the data in your FitBit WeatherCast app up to 16 times a day.  

First, you will need to create a new user in the AccuWeather website: [AccuWeather APIs | User account](https://developer.accuweather.com/user/register).  


## Steps:  
1. The following form will be presented. Just fill it in with your information and click on "Create New Account":

5. Fill in the information as shown below. The date doesn't matter. It is important to select "Limited trial". The limit is that you will only be able to refresh the data in the app 16 times per day. After you have filled in the information, click on "Create App":

If you uninstall and reinstall the app or if you perform a factory reset on your Fitbit and reinstall the WeatherCast app, you will have to provide this key again. I suggest you save it in a convenient place. If you lose it, you will have to log in at [AccuWeather APIs | home](https://developer.accuweather.com/) and repeat steps 6 and 7.
